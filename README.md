1. **Deviant-Code**: includes all the python scripts of the framework Deviant.
2. **Experiments_Scripts_and_Results**: includes all experiments reported in the paper (quantitative and qualitative) as well as the set of scripts used to generate the experiments.
3. **Datasets**: Contains the behavioral datasets used for the qualitative and quantitative experiments reported in the paper. 
4. **Example**: Contain an example of an input parameter file which allows to launch the method and uncover exceptional (dis-)agreement within groups.  

Below we give the method overview. Note that ```DEvIANT``` stands for Discovering statistically significant Exceptional contextual Intra-group Agreement paTterns.

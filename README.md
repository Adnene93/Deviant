This repository contains materials (Implementation and Experiments) concerning the paper in review: "DEvIANT : Discovering statistically significant exceptional (dis-)agreement within groups"
This repository contains the materials concerning the paper in review: Identifying exceptional (dis)agreement between groups. It contains:
1. **Deviant-Code**: includes all the python scripts of the framework Deviant.
2. **Experiments_Scripts_and_Results**: includes all experiments reported in the paper (quantitative and qualitative) as well as the set of scripts used to generate the experiments.
3. **Datasets**: Contains the behavioral datasets used for the qualitative and quantitative experiments reported in the paper. 
4. **Example**: Contain an example of an input parameter file which allows to launch the method and uncover exceptional (dis-)agreement within groups.  

Below we give the method overview. Note that ```DEvIANT``` stands for Discovering statistically significant Exceptional contextual Intra-group Agreement paTterns.

> ```DEvIANT``` is an exceptional model mining technique which, given a behavioral dataset, mines for statistically significant exceptional (dis-)agreement within groups. The patterns returned by ```DEvIANT``` are of the form ```(g,c)``` where ```g``` is a group (reviewers) of individuals and ```c``` a context characeterizing a subset of entities (reviewees). In a nutshell, ```DEvIANT``` starts by forming groups of individuals ___(1)___ by enumerating conditions/restrictions on the descriptive attributes of individuals. Next, ___(2)___  ```DEvIANT``` compute the bootstraping confidence interval to handle variablity of outcomes of the considered group. Subsequently, ___(3)___ ```DEvIANT``` select a context by enumerating conditions/restrictions on the descriptive attributes of entities handing over a subset of entities. For this subset of entities, ___(4)___ the corresponding contextual intra-group agreement is computed by using Krippendorff's Alpha. In order to evaluate how significant is the deviation from the expected intra-group agreement by chance, ___(5)___  ```DEvIANT``` follow establish the Distribution of False Discoveries, dubbed DFD. The DFD corresponds to the distribution of Krippendorff's Alpha observed over subsets uniformly issued from the collections of subsets of entities having equal cardinality to the subset covered by the current context. The DFD allows to determine if the observed intra-group agreement occurs due to chance only (a baseline finding) or is significant enough (considering some critical value alpha). If ___(6)___  the observed contextual intra-group agreement falls within the critical region, this means that the finding is significant and hence is reported in the returned resultr set ___(7)___ .
